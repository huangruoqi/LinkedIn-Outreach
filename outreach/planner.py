Usage:

Rules:
- Connection request notes must be ≤300 characters (LinkedIn hard limit — count carefully)

- Never use these phrases: "I came across your profile", "I'd love to pick your brain",

- Sound human and specific — not like a mass template
- You MUST open with or include the prospect's first name somewhere in the message
- Honor the stated end_goal: for none, write a warm note with no ask for a meeting, call, resume, or next-step scheduling
